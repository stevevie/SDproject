I've changed the database because there were some problems in my query. Now the db hasn't give problems anymore.I've only to check the 
solidity of DATATIME.
I've made Username in table Users, Unique. 
Now i've only to check methods with db, i'll do in evening.
When an user does the login, we have to take the id through a select.
Last thing i have to check if the username already exist in the db when we do the registration.
